*COCONUT CAKE*
--------------

-   ##### Ingredients

    -   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons (285 grams) all-purpose flour
    -   1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
    -   1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
    -   1/2 cup (110 grams) coconut oil, warmed just enough to liquefy
    -   1 1/2 cups full- or low-fat coconut milk
    -   1 tablespoon (15 ml) plain vinegar

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   ##### "Special" kitchen tools

    -   Oven (heat it to 350 degrees F)
    -   9-inch round cake pan
    -   A fitted round of parchment paper
    -   Nonstick cooking spray

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   ##### Steps

    -   Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease bottoms and sides of 2 (9-inch) round cake pans with shortening. Line pans with waxed paper; grese paper and lightly flour.
    -   In large bowl, beat cake mix, butter, coconut milk, water and eggs with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Pour butter into pans.
    -   Bake 33 to 38 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans to cooling racks; remove waxed paper. Cool completely, about 40 minutes.
    -   In medium bowl, stir together 2 cups of the coconut, the sugar and sour cream. Spoon 2 cups of the mixture into large bowl; stir in whipped topping, coconut extract and 1 cup of the remaining coconut. Set aside.
    -   Cut each cake horizontally to make 2 layers. Spread one-third (about 2/3 cup) of the coconut sour cream mixture without whipped topping on cut side of 1 layer. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining layer, cut side down.
    -   Frost top and side of cake with reserved coconut-whipped topping mixture. Press remaining coconut into top and side of cake. Cover; refrigerate 8 hours before serving.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   ##### Not a chocolate fan? Today is your day!

    -   We can make it with coconut oil and coconut milk, which together provide a subtle coconut flavor and rich, plushness to the cake we thought heretofore impossible in any cake, vegan or other!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   ##### If you want to add more ingredients?

    -   Add a pinch of salt, if you wish. Once cake is fully cool, spread over the top of the cake and smooth to the edges with a knife or small offset spatula, where it will find its way down the decoratively on its own. We can add some white confetti sprinkles, but toasted coconut chips would be nice here too.

**Euclidean Distance**
======================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean Distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline{\\textbf{pq}})$.
In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

$$\\begin{align}
d(\\textbf{p, q}) = d(\\textbf{q, p}) & = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot + (q\_n - p\_n)^2} \\\\
& =
\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^n (q\_i - p\_i)^2}
\\end{align}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$$\\begin{align}
\\lVert \\textbf{p} \\rVert = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p}\\cdot\\textbf{p}},
\\end{align}$$
 where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
