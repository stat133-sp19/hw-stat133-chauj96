## Binomial

The package `"binomial"` is an R package that implements functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the exptected value, variance, etc. Moreover, the package also gives the summary of Binomial and visualizes the summary.

## bin_choose()

Once you have defined `"success"` and `"trials"`, you can use the function `bin_choose()` to calculate the number of combinations in which k successes in n trials. However, your `"success"` cannot be larger than `"trials"`.

```{r}
bin_choose(trials = 5, success = 4)
```

## bin_probability()

In order to use `bin_probabiliy`, it needs `"success"`, `"trials"`, `"prob"` to be defined. The function computes the binomial probability. The users will be warned when there are some errors in the values of `"success"`, `"trials"`, `"prob"` (i.e `"success"` is greater than `"trials"`, `"trials"` is not an integer value, etc.)

```{r}
bin_probability(success = 3, trials = 4, prob = 0.5)
```

## bin_distribution()

The function `bin_probabiliy` calculates and displays the binomial probability of each number of success as a table.
```{r}
# binomial probability distribution
bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

It also has a plotting method that graphs a barplot to display the probability histogram of a binomial distribution.
```{r}
# plotting binomial probability distribution
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis1)
```

## bin_cumulative()

The function `bin_cumulative` should return a data frame with both the probability distribution and the cumulative probabilities.
```{r}
# binomial cumulative distribution
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

The users also can visualize the binomial cumulative distribution. Here is an example.
```{r}
# plotting binomial cumulative distribution
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis2)
```

## bin_variable()

The function `bin_variable` will return a nice print the content of an object such that `"success"`, `"trials"`.
```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
bin1
```

Moreover, the user can get a full summary description of an object, such that, `"trials"`, `"prob"`, `"mean"`, `"variance"`, `"mode"`, `"skewness"`, `"kurtosis"`.
```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, prob = 0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1
```


## bin_mean

The function `bin_mean` returns with the expected value or mean of a binomial distribution of the product of n trials and p probability.
```{r}
bin_mean(10, 0.3)
```

## bin_variance

The function `bin_variance` returns with the variance of the binomial distribution.
```{r}
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
```

## bin_mode

The function `bin_mode` returns with the mode of binomial mode.
```{r}
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
```

## bin_skewness

The function `bin_skewness` returns a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined.
```{r}
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
```

## bin_kurtosis

The function `bin_kurtosis` returns a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a random variable. 
```{r}
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
